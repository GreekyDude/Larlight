    <p>Yesterday, President Trump made his most controversial-yet speech to Americans.</p>
    <p>Among other minor announcements, he declared that every fast-food restaurant will be banned from the country. “…and on our path to make America great again, I must also ban fast-food restaurants from the country, as they have become too European controlled,” he said during yesterday’s rally.</p>

    <p>Since then, many Americans have expressed their disagreement, with thousands of protests erupting across the country. One of the biggest is currently taking place in Washington D.C., with protestors holding signs like “Save American Culture” and “Don’t Let Our History Die.”</p>

    <p>McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski announced this morning on X (formerly Twitter):</p>

    <blockquote><em>“Following President Trump’s announcement earlier today, our executive team is actively exploring plans to relocate McDonald’s global headquarters to the United Kingdom.”</em></blockquote>

    <p>While Burger King CEO, Daniel S. Schwartz more notably tweeted:</p>

    <blockquote><em>“We are not going down without a fight.”</em></blockquote>

    <p>During an interview two hours ago, Trump was asked if he would reverse the decision amid the chaos. He replied: “No, I will continue to make my bank a- (unintelligible) America great again no matter how many obstacles there are.”</p>
